I'm an eager learner, currently studying Systems Development at Uni and pursuing knowledge as I move forward. Currently studying Python, SQL, JavaScript, CSS and HTML, and I have so much planned already! As I develop my skills, I intend to study PHP, JavaScript libraries and frameworks (namely React and Node.js), and Bootstrap so I can bring to life all the projects I've envisioned.

So far I've been publishing my progress as I study so I can see how far I've come in the future. I'm also very passionate about other things: languages, gaming, anime... I like to take my time to do everything I like and balance out work and personal life. It's also fun to mix things up, as some of the projects I plan on developing involve my other interests too!

I hope to get to know more people in the area and improve my skills along the way!
